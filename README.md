# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System
**Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree – Functional Safety Project**

## Overview

This repository contains the complete functional safety documentation for an **automotive lane-assistance system**, developed as part of Udacity’s Self-Driving Car Nanodegree (Functional Safety module).

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to analyze safety risks in an automotive system and produce standardized safety documents similar to those created by a **Functional Safety Manager (FSM)** in industry (compliant with ISO 26262 practices).

You will find structured documentation including:
- Safety planning
- Hazard analysis and risk assessment
- Functional safety concept
- Technical safety concept
- Software requirements and architecture

## Deliverables

You are required to complete the following five documents:

| # | Document Name |
|--|--------------|
| 01 | Safety Plan |
| 02 | Hazard Analysis & Risk Assessment (HARA) |
| 03 | Functional Safety Concept |
| 04 | Technical Safety Concept |
| 05 | Software Requirements & Architecture |

These are provided as templates in the `Template_Files` directory. Completed versions can be found in `Functional-Safety-Documents`.

## How To Use This Repository

1. Start with the templates in `/Template_Files`
2. Use the diagrams from `/Architecture_Diagrams` where needed
3. Save completed files inside `/Functional-Safety-Documents`
4. Export final files as **PDF**
5. Submit according to Udacity guidelines

---

## Example Use Cases

- Academic demonstration of **ISO 26262 functional safety concepts**
- Reference for **ADAS / Lane Assist system design**
- Example for implementing **FSM-style documentation**
- Template base for real-world automotive safety studies

---

## Evaluation

The project is evaluated based on Udacity’s rubric:
- Completeness
- Accuracy
- Industry alignment
- Technical clarity
- Documentation quality

Refer to the classroom rubric for exact requirements.
